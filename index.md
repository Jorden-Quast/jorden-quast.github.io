Howdy!

I'm Jorden Quast, and I'm bumbling along, playing with the idea of putting things on the internet.

In my ideal world, in my head, I'd have a lot of fun with this, having three separate categories of posts:

1. School Review Notes, so that hopefully someone can get some use out of them
2. Blog, for my incoherent ramblings I decide to grace the world with
3. Bible, My research on the Bible. They're blog posts, but they felt special so they go in their own section

This project is a work in progress, and will continue to be a work in progress as long as my hyperfixation allows, so we'll see I suppose.
