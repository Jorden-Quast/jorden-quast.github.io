Howdy! Welcome to the website! It's a little something I've put together as a side project, using a domain name that I've owned for a few years now.
In case you're confused on the name, 404 is a HTTP status code saying that a resource is not being found. The name "Breaking 404" comes from the idea
of turning missing information into... not that, and since you have the resource now, it's no longer a "404" in your head.

Here, you'll find my review notes for my classes. I wrote them for my personal studying, but as I wrote them, my goal was to teach the concept in the
format of building intuition about the material. There will be very few (if any) example problems in them, as they give us enough homework already.
Instead, my hope was to "derive" everything to a reasonable extent, opening all of the boxes, and never giving a formula while saying "trust me". I
sort these by class on the <a href="{{ site.url }}/reviews">Class Reviews</a> page of the site, in addition to providing any additional information I
might find relevant to the class. Because there can be pertinent information not included in the post, I have left those out of the listing below, to
find them, please go to the class reviews page.

Also, because I have the space, there's also the potential to see something of "blogs" on the site. I like to run thought experiments and dissect
ideas in my head, and if I ever find an idea particularly interesting, or I feel like it's worth sharing, I might write it down and put it on the <a
href="{{ site.url}}/blogs">Blogs</a> page of the site.

Finally, while I study the Bible, I will sometimes take notes on a topic I'm particularly interested in. Sometimes, I might upload them to the <a
href="{{ site.url}}/bible">Bible Notes</a> page of the site, in the off chance that someone might find them useful. I don't claim to be a scholar by
any means, I actually know very, very little and all of my writings are based on my own understanding, so if you find anything helpful, I give full
credit to God... I only take responsibility for the confusing bits.
