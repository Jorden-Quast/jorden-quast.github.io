## Howdy!

My name is Jorden Quast, and I am an Electrical Engineering student at Texas A&M University. I look like this:

In the fall semester of my sophomore year, I realized I loved to teach, and to study, I wrote reviews for my classes in the form of teaching it to
someone else. For fun (on the off chance it helps someone), I'm uploading them here, and that's the primary focus of this site.

In addition to reviews, I will also occasionally write things I think about down, as little blog posts, but I'm not known for keeping hobbies like
these too well, so we'll see how it goes.

I hope you're having a great day, and please remember: **Today's a great day to be alive, you're valuable, and you're doing *amazing***
